## Rule Evaluation Matrix

| Rule ID | Rule Name | Check Type | Expected | Actual | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOG_DQ_001 | Log Parseability | completeness | >=99% | 89.36% | ❌ | High |
| LOG_DQ_002 | HTTP Status Validity | validity | Only [200,201,204] | 200,401,403,404,500,502,503 observed | ❌ | Low |

## Detailed Rule Findings

| Rule ID | Observations |
|---|---|
| LOG_DQ_001 | None observed |
| LOG_DQ_002 | Observed status codes: 200: 28, 401: 3, 403: 2, 404: 2, 500: 4, 502: 2, 503: 2; Error class summary: 4xx: 7, 5xx: 8 |
| LOG_DQ_003 | None observed |
| LOG_DQ_004 | 5xx breakdown: 500: 4, 502: 2, 503: 2 |

## Recommendations

| Priority | Area | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| High | Log Parseability | Review log generation and parsing to ensure >=99% parseability. |
| Low | HTTP Status Validity | Investigate non-2xx HTTP status codes; ensure only [200,201,204] are present as expected. |
| Medium | Response Size Presence | Ensure response_size field is present in >=98% of records. |
| Medium | 5xx Error Rate | Investigate and reduce 5xx error responses to <=2%. |
